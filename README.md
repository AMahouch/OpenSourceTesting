# Survey on the Open-source Tools for Software Testing and Maintenance

Software testing and maintenance play a critical role in ensuring the quality, and thus success, of a software product. Software testing is one of the most widely used approaches to ensuring software quality and often consumes more than 50% of the total cost of a software project. Software maintenance is key to providing continuity of service and is mainly concerned with how to control and manage software changes and evolution after the major features are released.

We list the available tools for each of the following topics and demo how to use them in either text or video format or both with concrete examples.
