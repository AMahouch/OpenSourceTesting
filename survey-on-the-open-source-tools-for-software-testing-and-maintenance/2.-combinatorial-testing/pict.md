# PICT

## Description

Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing (PICT) is an open source software tool developed by Microsoft Resarch for automating the process of combinatorial testing. It generates a set of test cases that cover all possible combinations of input parameters while keeping the number of test cases relatively small. This is especially useful when dealing with systems with a large number of configuration options\
\
With PICT, [you can generate tests that are more effective than manually generated tests and in a fraction of the time required by hands-on test case design.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
