## Description

\
JaCoCo is an open-source Java code coverage library. It can be used to measure the percentage of code that is executed by tests. JaCoCo can be used to measure line coverage, branch coverage, and method coverage.

JaCoCo works by instrumenting bytecode during runtime. This means that JaCoCo adds additional code to bytecode that tracks which lines of code are executed. JaCoCo can then generate reports that show you which lines of code are covered by your tests and which lines of code are not covered.

The following demo illustrates the effectiveness of JaCoCo to evaluate test case coverage.
