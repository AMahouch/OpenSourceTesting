# 5. Test Data Generation

## Description

Test data generation is the process of creating input data for a software program to test its functionality. Test data can be generated manually or automatically. Automated test data generation can help to improve the coverage and quality of testing.

#### Symbolic Execution

Symbolic execution is a technique that executes a program using symbolic values instead of concrete values. Symbolic execution can be used to generate test data by solving the path conditions for a given path through the program.

#### Search-Based Generation

Search-based generation is a technique that uses search algorithms to generate test data. Search-based generation can be used to generate test data for complex programs with many inputs.
