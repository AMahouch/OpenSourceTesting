# 6. Data Flow Testing

## Description

#### Definition/Use

* a definition is a location where a value for a variable is stored into memory
* a use is a location where a variable's value is accessed

#### Data Flow Graph (DFG)

A data flow graph captures the flow of data in a program. It is fundamentally built upon Control Flow Graph (CFG), with each node annotated with either

* def(n) : set of variables defined in node n
* use(n): the set of variables used in node n
