# JavaDataFlow

## Description

JavaDataFlow is a Java library that allows you to create data flow graphs from Java input classes JavaDataFlow can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

* **Data flow analysis:** JavaDataFlow can be used to perform data flow analysis on Java programs. This can be used to detect errors in programs, such as unreachable code or unused variables.
* **Code optimization:** JavaDataFlow can be used to optimize Java code. For example, JavaDataFlow can be used to identify redundant computations or to reorder code to improve performance.
* **Debugging:** JavaDataFlow can be used to debug Java programs. For example, JavaDataFlow can be used to track the flow of data through a program to identify the source of a bug.
