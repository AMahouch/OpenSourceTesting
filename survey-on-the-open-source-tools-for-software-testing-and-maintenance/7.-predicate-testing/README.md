# 7. Predicate Testing

## Description

Predicate testing is a software testing technique that focuses on ensuring that the predicates in a program are implemented correctly. Predicates are Boolean expressions that can be evaluated to either true or false, often being used in decision statements to determine which path of execution to take.

Predicate testing can be used to test both **program-based predicates** and **specification-based predicates**.

* Program-based predicates are those that can be identified from the branching points of the source code.
* Specification-based predicates are those that can be identified from the formal and informal requirements for the program, as well as from behavioral models such as finite state machines.

| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Predicate Coverage                       |             |
| Clause Coverage                          |             |
| Combinatorial Coverage                   |             |
| Active Clause Coverage (ACC)             |             |
| General Active Clause Coverage (GACC)    |             |
| Correlated Active Clause Coverage (CACC) |             |
| Restricted Active Clause Coverage (RACC) |             |
