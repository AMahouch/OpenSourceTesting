# 8. Security Testing

## Description

In software engineering, our goal is to build software that is resistant to malicious attacks. It is important to consider security concerns from the beginning of a project, and to continually build security into software rather than adding it on later.

An important aspect of software security is to protect **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of data. Moreover, it is critical to ensure proper **authentication** and **authorization** of end users.
